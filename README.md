# Weather Teller ⛅️

## Introduction
A simple web app project built to review EJS and Ajax/JQuery and to have fun with designing characters in the app.

### Purpose
This app allows you to look at the current weather anywhere in the world by clicking locations on the displayed map or manually adding longitude/latitude values.
Based on the current weather, the potato character will change to reflect the weather!
